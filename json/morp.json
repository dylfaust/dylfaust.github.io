    "description": "An <strong>educational game</strong> I developed with Meadowlark Science and Education. It took place in a world of anthropomorphic mice, where the player was tasked with <strong>solving the mystery</strong> of why Mrs. Wirth was getting sick, by using <strong>environmental observation</strong> and <strong>scientific deduction</strong>. The main gameplay was composed of <strong>first person exploration</strong> and <strong>puzzle solving</strong>, with the occasional <strong>mini-games</strong> to demonstrate various parts of the scientific process. I focused my time with Meadowlark on the <strong>game design</strong> of both the <strong>core game loop</strong>, and a few of the <strong>mini-games</strong>. I also helped <strong>implement</strong> the <strong>systems</strong> for various minigames, and <strong>graphic designed</strong> / <strong>animated</strong> 2d art.",
