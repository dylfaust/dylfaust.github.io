  "description": "An <strong>educational game</strong> I developed with Meadowlark Science and Education, through the University of Montana Science Department. It took place in a world of anthropomorphic mice, where the player was tasked with <strong>solving the mystery</strong> of why Mrs. Wirth was getting sick, by using <strong>environmental observation</strong> and <strong>scientific deduction</strong>. The main gameplay was composed of <strong>first person exploration</strong> and <strong>puzzle solving</strong>, with the occasional <strong>mini-games</strong> to demonstrate various parts of the scientific process. I focused my time with Meadowlark on the game design of both the main game loop, and a few of the mini-games. I also helped implement the systems for various minigames, and graphic designed / animated 2d art.",
