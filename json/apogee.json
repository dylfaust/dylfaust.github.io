    "description": "<strong>Winner</strong> of the <strong>Best Interactive Award</strong> at the University of Montana Media Arts Expo 2015.<br><br>Based on my initial pitch, this game was built over the course of <strong>5 months</strong> with a <strong>team of five</strong> digital artists / game designers. Apogee is a <strong>first person exploration game</strong>, made exclusively for the <strong>Oculus Rift</strong>. You play as a space rover dropped onto an <strong>alien planet</strong>, with no context as to why you're there. The game focuses on a <strong>growth mechanic</strong>, where the player must collect / disperse energy to grow and shrink, granting them access to various places on the planet, to try and <strong>piece together the game's backstory</strong>. Apogee takes place on a <strong>fully spherical planet</strong>, which the player can explore in its entirety.",
