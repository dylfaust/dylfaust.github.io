  "description": "<strong>Winner</strong> of the <strong>Technical Achievement Award</strong> and the <strong>Studio Prize</strong> at the Sammy Showcase 2017.<br><br>Based on a concept which <strong>I conceived and pitched</strong>, CtrlShift is a <strong>2 player coop VR</strong> game, which only requires one VR headset. One player wears the VR headset and plays the role of <strong>the Spy</strong>, <strong>physically sneaking</strong> through the environment, and trying to make it to the mainframe unseen. The other player utilizes the keyboard and computer monitor to the play the role of <strong>the Hacker</strong>, <strong>typing in code</strong> to a command line interface to <strong>hack the environment</strong> in their Spy's favor. Both players have incomplete views of the environment, so they have to <strong>communicate</strong> and <strong>trust</strong> one another in order to succeed.",
