  "description": "SolarScreen is an app that gives you <strong>real time updates</strong> on the intensity of <strong>UV rays</strong> harmful to skin in <strong>your region</strong>, as well as sending you <strong>reminders</strong> to reapply your <strong>sunscreen</strong>. I <strong>built</strong> the <strong>iOS</strong> and <strong>Apple Watch</strong> versions of SolarScreen from the ground up, for Montana Root Applications Inc, and <strong>supported it after release</strong> with bug fixes and new features. <br><br>One of my favorite parts of this job was <strong>designing</strong> and <strong>implementing</strong> the <strong>UI / UX</strong> for SolarScreen. I worked closely with our CEO Ryan Duarte, and would design / iterate on mockups with his feedback. I also <strong>graphic designed</strong> some <strong>marketing materials</strong>, and internal pamphlets for the company.",
