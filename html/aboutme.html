          I'm a <b>game designer</b> with a keen eye for polish. My goal is to leverage my
          background in <b>animation</b> and <b>programming</b>, to build beautiful and unique games from the ground up.
          <br><br>
          I recently found a good opportunity to combine these disciplines, and
          served as the <b>UI Scripter</b> on <b>The Last of Us Part II</b>.
          <br><br>
          I'm passionate about <b>collaborating</b> with team members of all disciplines; coming from a
          multi-disciplinary
          background
          myself, I feel strongly that this cross-pollination is how the <b>best experiences</b>, and most <b>cohesive
            products</b>, are
          made.
