  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <div class="container window-large-container">
    <p>
      I'm a <b>game designer</b> with a keen eye for polish. My goal is to leverage my
      background in <b>animation</b> and <b>programming</b>, to build beautiful and unique games from the ground up.
      <br><br>
      I recently found a good opportunity to combine these disciplines, and
      served as the <b>UI Scripter</b> on <b>The Last of Us Part II</b>.
      <br><br>
      I'm passionate about <b>collaborating</b> with team members of all disciplines; coming from a multi-disciplinary
      background
      myself, I feel strongly that this cross-pollination is how the <b>best experiences</b>, and most <b>cohesive products</b>, are
      made.
